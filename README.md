BUILDER DESIGN PATTER

geeksforgeeks : “Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.”

If the Object is complicated, break it into elements of same or different type, then construct.
If the elements are of same type, one builder in the object, could do the work.
If the elements are different type, more builder might be needed.
